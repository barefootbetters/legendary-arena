## Current State

### WP-009B — Scheme & Mastermind Rule Execution Minimal MVP (2026-04-11)

**What changed:**
- `packages/game-engine/src/rules/ruleRuntime.execute.ts` — **new** — defines
  `ImplementationMap` type (handler functions keyed by hook `id`, no boardgame.io
  import), `executeRuleHooks` (reads `G`, calls `getHooksForTrigger`, accumulates
  `RuleEffect[]`, returns without modifying `G`)
- `packages/game-engine/src/rules/ruleRuntime.effects.ts` — **new** — defines
  `applyRuleEffects` (applies effects using `for...of`: `queueMessage` pushes to
  `G.messages`, `modifyCounter` updates `G.counters`, `drawCards` draws using
  zoneOps helpers, `discardHand` uses `moveAllCards`, unknown types push warning
  — never throws)
- `packages/game-engine/src/rules/ruleRuntime.impl.ts` — **new** — default stub
  implementations: `defaultSchemeImplementation` (onTurnStart → "Scheme: turn
  started."), `defaultMastermindImplementation` (onTurnEnd → "Mastermind: turn
  ended."), `DEFAULT_IMPLEMENTATION_MAP`, `buildDefaultHookDefinitions`
- `packages/game-engine/src/rules/ruleRuntime.ordering.test.ts` — **new** —
  3 ordering tests (priority ordering, id tiebreak, missing handler graceful skip)
- `packages/game-engine/src/rules/ruleRuntime.integration.test.ts` — **new** —
  6 integration tests (onTurnStart message, onTurnEnd message, JSON round-trip,
  executeRuleHooks read-only, modifyCounter, unknown effect warning)
- `packages/game-engine/src/types.ts` — **modified** — added `messages: string[]`,
  `counters: Record<string, number>`, `hookRegistry: HookDefinition[]` to
  `LegendaryGameState`
- `packages/game-engine/src/game.ts` — **modified** — wired `onTurnStart` trigger
  in `play` phase `turn.onBegin`, added `turn.onEnd` with `onTurnEnd` trigger;
  both use `executeRuleHooks` → `applyRuleEffects` pipeline with
  `DEFAULT_IMPLEMENTATION_MAP`
- `packages/game-engine/src/index.ts` — **modified** — exports `ImplementationMap`,
  `executeRuleHooks`, `applyRuleEffects`, `buildDefaultHookDefinitions`
- `docs/ai/DECISIONS.md` — added D-1232 (ImplementationMap pattern), D-1233
  (two-step execute/apply), D-1234 (graceful unknown effect handling)

**Runtime Wiring Allowance (01.5):** Exercised for
`packages/game-engine/src/setup/buildInitialGameState.ts` — added `messages: []`,
`counters: {}`, `hookRegistry: buildDefaultHookDefinitions(config)` to the return
object. Import of `buildDefaultHookDefinitions` added. No new behavior introduced.

**What exists now:**
- The complete two-step rule execution pipeline is operational:
  `executeRuleHooks` → `applyRuleEffects`
- `LegendaryGameState` includes `messages`, `counters`, and `hookRegistry`
- On each turn start in the play phase, the default scheme hook fires and
  `G.messages` receives `'Scheme: turn started.'`
- On each turn end in the play phase, the default mastermind hook fires and
  `G.messages` receives `'Mastermind: turn ended.'`
- `ImplementationMap` handler functions live outside `G` — never in state
- Unknown effect types degrade gracefully (warning in `G.messages`, no throw)
- No `.reduce()` in effect application; no `.sort()` in `executeRuleHooks`
- No `boardgame.io` imports in any `src/rules/` file
- WP-009A contract files (`ruleHooks.types.ts`, `ruleHooks.validate.ts`,
  `ruleHooks.registry.ts`) untouched
- 108 tests pass (99 prior + 9 new), 0 fail
- Build exits 0

### WP-009A — Scheme & Mastermind Rule Hooks Contracts (2026-04-11)

**What changed:**
- `packages/game-engine/src/rules/ruleHooks.types.ts` — **new** — defines
  `RuleTriggerName` (5-value union), `RULE_TRIGGER_NAMES` canonical array,
  5 trigger payload interfaces (`OnTurnStartPayload`, `OnTurnEndPayload`,
  `OnCardRevealedPayload`, `OnSchemeTwistRevealedPayload`,
  `OnMastermindStrikeRevealedPayload`), `TriggerPayloadMap`,
  `RuleEffect` (4-variant tagged union), `RULE_EFFECT_TYPES` canonical array,
  `HookDefinition` (data-only, 5 fields), `HookRegistry` type alias
- `packages/game-engine/src/rules/ruleHooks.validate.ts` — **new** — three
  validators (`validateTriggerPayload`, `validateRuleEffect`,
  `validateHookDefinition`); all return `MoveResult`; none throw
- `packages/game-engine/src/rules/ruleHooks.registry.ts` — **new** —
  `createHookRegistry` (validates and stores; throws on invalid),
  `getHooksForTrigger` (returns hooks sorted by priority asc, then id lexically)
- `packages/game-engine/src/rules/ruleHooks.contracts.test.ts` — **new** —
  10 tests including 2 drift-detection tests for `RULE_TRIGGER_NAMES` and
  `RULE_EFFECT_TYPES`
- `packages/game-engine/src/types.ts` — **modified** — re-exports
  `RuleTriggerName`, `RuleEffect`, `HookDefinition`, `HookRegistry`
- `packages/game-engine/src/index.ts` — **modified** — exports all new public
  types, constants, validators, and registry helpers
- `docs/ai/DECISIONS.md` — added D-1229 (HookDefinition is data-only),
  D-1230 (effects are tagged data union), D-1231 (priority-then-id ordering)

**What exists now:**
- `@legendary-arena/game-engine` exports the complete rule hook contract surface:
  trigger names, payload shapes, effect types, hook definitions, validators,
  and registry helpers
- All rule hook types are JSON-serializable (no functions, Maps, Sets, or classes)
- `MoveError` from WP-008A is reused for all validator errors — no new error types
- `CardExtId` used for all card references in trigger payloads
- No `boardgame.io` imports in any `src/rules/` file
- Drift-detection tests prevent silent additions to trigger names or effect types
- 99 tests pass (89 prior + 10 new), 0 fail
- Build exits 0

**Runtime Wiring Allowance:** Not exercised. No files outside the WP allowlist
were modified. Adding re-exports to `types.ts` and `index.ts` did not break
any existing structural assertions.

### WP-047 — Code Style Reference Governance Alignment (2026-04-10)

**What changed:**
- `docs/ai/REFERENCE/00.6-code-style.md` — **modified** — replaced header
  blockquote with Authority & Scope section declaring subordination to
  ARCHITECTURE.md and `.claude/rules/code-style.md`; documented three
  complementary code-style artifacts (00.6 descriptive reference,
  `.claude/rules/code-style.md` enforcement, 00.3 §16 quality gate);
  preserved scope statement, enforcement mapping, and change policy
- `docs/ai/DECISIONS.md` — added D-1404 (code style reference is descriptive
  while rules file is enforcement; three-artifact relationship; parallels
  D-1401/D-1402/D-1403)

**What exists now:**
- The code style reference explicitly declares subordination to ARCHITECTURE.md
  and `.claude/rules/code-style.md`
- Style rules never override architectural constraints or layer boundaries
- The three-artifact relationship is documented: 00.6 (descriptive with
  examples), `.claude/rules/code-style.md` (enforcement), 00.3 §16 (quality
  gate)
- All 15 existing rules preserved exactly — no rules added, removed, or weakened
- All code examples preserved
- Enforcement mapping table (18 §16.* entries) preserved
- Change policy preserved
- No `.claude/rules/` files modified
- No scripts modified
- No TypeScript code produced

### WP-046 — R2 Validation Governance Alignment (2026-04-10)

**What changed:**
- `docs/ai/REFERENCE/00.5-validation.md` — **modified** — added
  subordination clause in header (document is subordinate to ARCHITECTURE.md
  and `.claude/rules/*.md`); added Foundation Prompt vs Lint Gate distinction;
  added Layer Boundary note identifying registry/data layer with reference to
  `.claude/rules/registry.md`; added WP-042 distinction (reusable preflight
  vs operational deployment checklists); added Execution Gate section with
  stop-on-failure semantics naming Foundation Prompts 01, 02 as blocked on
  error (warnings alone do not block)
- `docs/ai/DECISIONS.md` — added D-1403 (R2 validation gate remains REFERENCE
  document; R2 validation vs Lint Gate distinction; warnings vs errors;
  position in Foundation Prompts sequence)

**What exists now:**
- The R2 validation gate explicitly declares subordination to ARCHITECTURE.md
  and `.claude/rules/*.md`
- The R2 validation vs Lint Gate distinction is documented: R2 validation is a
  Foundation Prompt prerequisite (runs once after 00.4); Lint Gate is a per-WP
  quality gate (runs before each WP)
- Layer Boundary note identifies the document as registry/data-layer validation,
  referencing `.claude/rules/architecture.md` ("Layer Boundary (Authoritative)")
  and `.claude/rules/registry.md` for data shape conventions
- WP-042 distinction documented: 00.5 is a reusable preflight script; WP-042
  documents operational deployment procedures
- Execution Gate section makes stop-on-failure semantics explicit: if any
  error-level check fails, Foundation Prompts 01/02 and all Work Packets
  depending on R2 data are blocked; warnings alone do not block
- No existing validation checks removed or weakened
- No scripts modified

**Known gaps:** None — documentation-only packet.

### WP-045 — Connection Health Check Governance Alignment (2026-04-10)

**What changed:**
- `docs/ai/REFERENCE/00.4-connection-health-check.md` — **modified** — added
  subordination clause in header (document is subordinate to ARCHITECTURE.md
  and `.claude/rules/*.md`); added Foundation Prompt vs Lint Gate distinction;
  added Layer Boundary note identifying server/ops layer with reference to
  `.claude/rules/server.md`; added Execution Gate section with stop-on-failure
  semantics naming Foundation Prompts 00.5, 01, 02 as blocked on failure
- `docs/ai/DECISIONS.md` — added D-1402 (health check remains REFERENCE
  document; health check vs Lint Gate distinction)

**What exists now:**
- The connection health check explicitly declares subordination to
  ARCHITECTURE.md and `.claude/rules/*.md`
- The health check vs Lint Gate distinction is documented: health check is a
  Foundation Prompt prerequisite (runs once); Lint Gate is a per-WP quality
  gate (runs before each WP)
- Layer Boundary note identifies the document as server/ops layer tooling,
  referencing `.claude/rules/architecture.md` ("Layer Boundary (Authoritative)")
  and `.claude/rules/server.md` for script governance
- Execution Gate section makes stop-on-failure semantics explicit: if any
  health check fails, Foundation Prompts 00.5/01/02 and all Work Packets
  are blocked
- No existing health checks removed or weakened
- No scripts modified

**Known gaps:** None — documentation-only packet.

### WP-044 — Prompt Lint Governance Alignment (2026-04-10)

**What changed:**
- `docs/ai/REFERENCE/00.3-prompt-lint-checklist.md` — **modified** — added
  subordination clause in header (checklist is subordinate to ARCHITECTURE.md
  and `.claude/rules/*.md`); added Layer Boundary context check in §4; added
  governance note and Layer Boundary violation check in §8; added code style
  companion note in §16
- `docs/ai/DECISIONS.md` — added D-1401 (checklist remains REFERENCE, not
  merged into rules)

**What exists now:**
- The prompt lint checklist explicitly declares subordination to ARCHITECTURE.md
  and `.claude/rules/*.md`
- §4 requires Layer Boundary reference in Context when packets touch layer
  boundaries or package imports
- §8 opens with authoritative governance note citing ARCHITECTURE.md Section 1
  & 5 and `.claude/rules/architecture.md` "Layer Boundary (Authoritative)"
- §16 opens with companion note citing `00.6-code-style.md` and
  `.claude/rules/code-style.md`
- Checkbox count: 142 (was 139; +2 in §4, +1 in §8)
- No existing lint rules removed or weakened

**Known gaps:** None — documentation-only packet.

### WP-043 — Data Contracts Reference (2026-04-10)

**What changed:**
- `docs/ai/REFERENCE/00.2-data-requirements.md` — **replaced** — legacy 755-line
  document (13 sections including UI concerns) replaced with governed 8-section
  data contracts reference covering card shapes, metadata lookups, image
  conventions, PostgreSQL schema, ability text markup, mastermind-villain
  relationships, match configuration, and authority notes
- `docs/ai/ARCHITECTURE.md` — cross-reference already adequate at line 136;
  no modification needed
- `docs/ai/DECISIONS.md` — added D-1301 (legacy section exclusion rationale)
  and D-1302 (subordination to schema.ts rationale)

**What exists now:**
- `docs/ai/REFERENCE/00.2-data-requirements.md` is the governed data contracts
  reference, subordinate to `schema.ts` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Legacy 00.2 content archived at `docs/archive prompts-legendary-area-game/`
- All card data shapes, metadata lookup shapes, image URL construction rules,
  ability text markup tokens, and PostgreSQL table inventory are documented with
  real JSON examples and field reference tables
- Legacy sections §7 (user deck data), §9 (search/filter), §10 (preferences),
  §11 (app config), §12 (export) excluded as UI-layer concerns (D-1301)

**Known gaps:** None — documentation-only packet.

### Foundation Prompt 00.4 — Connection & Environment Health Check (2026-04-09)

**What exists now:**
- `scripts/check-connections.mjs` — Node.js ESM health check for all external
  services (PostgreSQL, boardgame.io server, Cloudflare R2, Cloudflare Pages,
  GitHub API, rclone R2 bucket)
- `scripts/Check-Env.ps1` — PowerShell tooling check (Node, pnpm, dotenv-cli,
  git, rclone, .env file, npm packages) — runs without Node.js or network
- `.env.example` — definitive 9-variable reference for the whole project
- `pnpm check` and `pnpm check:env` script entries in package.json

**What a developer can do:**
- Run `pwsh scripts/Check-Env.ps1` on a fresh machine to verify all tools
- Run `pnpm check` to verify all external service connections
- Both produce clear pass/fail reports with remediation for every failure

**Known gaps (expected at this stage):**
- No .env file yet (must be created from .env.example)
- boardgame.io and zod not installed (no game-engine package yet)
- PostgreSQL and game server connections will fail until Foundation Prompt 01

### Foundation Prompt 00.5 — R2 Data & Image Validation (2026-04-09)

**What exists now:**
- `scripts/validate-r2.mjs` — Node.js ESM R2 validation with 4 phases:
  Phase 1: registry check (sets.json), Phase 2: per-set metadata validation,
  Phase 3: image spot-checks (HEAD only), Phase 4: cross-set slug deduplication
- `pnpm validate` runs the full validation against live R2 (no .env needed)

**Live validation results (2026-04-09):**
- 40 sets validated, 0 errors, 74 warnings (known data quality issues)
- 6 missing images (URL pattern mismatches on specific sets)
- 43 cross-set duplicate slugs (expected — same heroes appear in multiple sets)

**Known data quality issues (per 00.2 §12):**
- `[object Object]` abilities in msmc, bkpt, msis sets
- Missing `vp` field on 2 masterminds in mgtg set
- 1 hero card missing `cost` and `hc` in anni set

### Foundation Prompt 01 — Render.com Backend Setup (2026-04-09)

**What exists now:**
- `apps/server/` — new pnpm workspace package (`@legendary-arena/server`)
  - `src/rules/loader.mjs` — loads `legendary.rules` and `legendary.rule_docs`
    from PostgreSQL at startup, caches in memory, exports `loadRules()` and
    `getRules()`
  - `src/game/legendary.mjs` — minimal boardgame.io `Game()` definition wired
    to the rules cache. Placeholder move (`playCard`) and endgame condition.
    No real game logic — that belongs in `packages/game-engine/` (WP-002+).
  - `src/server.mjs` — boardgame.io `Server()` with CORS (production SPA +
    localhost:5173), `/health` endpoint on koa router, rules count logging
  - `src/index.mjs` — process entrypoint with SIGTERM graceful shutdown
- `data/schema-server.sql` — rules-engine DDL subset (sets, masterminds,
  villain_groups, schemes, rules, rule_docs) in `legendary.*` namespace.
  All tables use `bigserial` PKs, `IF NOT EXISTS`, indexed.
- `data/seed-server.sql` — seed data with complete Galactus (Core Set)
  example: set, mastermind (strike 5, vp 6), Heralds of Galactus villain
  group, Brotherhood, two schemes. Wrapped in a transaction.
- `render.yaml` — Render infrastructure-as-code provisioning web service
  + managed PostgreSQL (starter plan) in one deploy

**What a developer can do:**
- `pnpm install` detects the new server workspace and installs deps
- `node --env-file=.env apps/server/src/server.mjs` starts the server
- `GET /health` returns `{ "status": "ok" }` for Render and pnpm check
- `psql $DATABASE_URL -f data/schema-server.sql` creates rules-engine tables
- `psql $DATABASE_URL -f data/seed-server.sql` seeds Galactus example
- `render deploy` provisions both services from `render.yaml`

**Known gaps (expected at this stage):**
- No real game logic — `LegendaryGame` is a placeholder (WP-002)
- No card registry loading at startup (WP-003 registry package needed)
- No authentication (separate WP)
- No lobby/match creation CLI scripts (WP-011/012)

### Foundation Prompt 02 — Database Migrations (2026-04-09)

**What exists now:**
- `scripts/migrate.mjs` — zero-dependency ESM migration runner using `pg` only.
  Reads `.sql` files from `data/migrations/`, applies them in filename order,
  tracks applied migrations in `public.schema_migrations`. Resolves `\i`
  directives (psql includes) by inlining referenced files. Strips embedded
  `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` wrappers to avoid nested transaction issues.
- `data/migrations/001_server_schema.sql` — includes `data/schema-server.sql`
  (rules-engine DDL: legendary.source_files, sets, masterminds, villain_groups,
  schemes, rules, rule_docs)
- `data/migrations/002_seed_rules.sql` — includes `data/seed_rules.sql`
  (rules index + rule_docs glossary + source_files audit records)
- `data/migrations/003_game_sessions.sql` — creates `public.game_sessions`
  table for match tracking (match_id, status, player_count, mastermind_ext_id,
  scheme_ext_id). Uses `text` ext_id references, not bigint FKs.
- `render.yaml` buildCommand updated to run migrations before server start
- `pnpm migrate` script entry in root package.json

**What a developer can do:**
- `pnpm migrate` applies pending migrations against local PostgreSQL
- Running twice is safe — idempotent (0 applied, 3 skipped on second run)
- `render deploy` runs migrations automatically in the build step

**Known gaps (expected at this stage):**
- No rollback mechanism (manual recovery via `psql` if needed)
- No real game logic — game_sessions table is created but not yet used
- Card registry not loaded at startup (WP-003 needed)

### WP-004 — Server Bootstrap: Game Engine + Registry Integration (2026-04-09)

**What changed:**
- `apps/server/src/game/legendary.mjs` — replaced placeholder `Game()` definition
  with a thin re-export of `LegendaryGame` from `@legendary-arena/game-engine`
- `apps/server/src/server.mjs` — imports `LegendaryGame` from
  `@legendary-arena/game-engine` and `createRegistryFromLocalFiles` from
  `@legendary-arena/registry`. Loads registry at startup alongside rules.
  Uses `createRequire` to bridge boardgame.io's CJS-only server bundle.
- `apps/server/package.json` — added `@legendary-arena/game-engine` and
  `@legendary-arena/registry` as workspace dependencies
- `apps/server/src/index.mjs` — added `// why:` comment explaining entrypoint
  vs configuration module separation
- `render.yaml` — already had correct `startCommand`, no change needed

**What a developer can do:**
- `node --env-file=.env apps/server/src/index.mjs` starts the server with
  real game engine and card registry
- Server logs show both startup tasks:
  - `[server] registry loaded: 40 sets, 288 heroes, 2620 cards`
  - `[server] rules loaded: 19 rules, 18 rule docs`
- `GET /health` returns `{"status":"ok"}`
- `POST /games/legendary-arena/create` with `setupData` returns a `matchID`
- Missing `setupData` returns HTTP 400 with a descriptive message (not 500)
- `numPlayers` outside 1-5 returns HTTP 400 (`minPlayers: 1`, `maxPlayers: 5`
  on `LegendaryGame`, enforced by boardgame.io lobby)

**Known gaps (expected at this stage):**
- No lobby/match creation CLI scripts yet (WP-011/012)
- No authentication (separate WP)

### WP-005A — Match Setup Contracts (2026-04-10)

**What changed:**
- `packages/game-engine/src/matchSetup.types.ts` — **new** — defines the
  canonical `MatchSetupConfig` (9 locked fields), `MatchSetupError`
  (`{ field, message }`), and `ValidateMatchSetupResult` (discriminated union)
- `packages/game-engine/src/matchSetup.validate.ts` — **new** —
  `validateMatchSetup(input, registry)` checks both shape and registry ext_id
  existence; never throws; returns structured result. Defines
  `CardRegistryReader` interface to respect the layer boundary.
- `packages/game-engine/src/types.ts` — **modified** — `MatchConfiguration` is
  now a type alias for `MatchSetupConfig` (both had identical 9-field shapes)
- `packages/game-engine/src/index.ts` — **modified** — exports
  `MatchSetupConfig`, `MatchSetupError`, `ValidateMatchSetupResult`,
  `validateMatchSetup`, and `CardRegistryReader`
- `packages/game-engine/src/matchSetup.contracts.test.ts` — **new** — 4 contract
  tests using inline mock registry (no boardgame.io imports)

**What a subsequent session can rely on:**
- `@legendary-arena/game-engine` exports the canonical match setup contract types
- `validateMatchSetup` validates both shape and ext_id existence
- `MatchConfiguration` is a type alias for `MatchSetupConfig` — both work
- The validator never throws — `Game.setup()` decides whether to throw
- `CardRegistryReader` is the minimal interface the validator needs from a registry

**Known gaps (expected at this stage):**
- No deterministic shuffling or deck construction — that is WP-005B
- No changes to `Game.setup()` — that is WP-005B
- No gameplay moves, rules, or phases

### WP-005B — Deterministic Setup Implementation (2026-04-10)

**What changed:**
- `packages/game-engine/src/types.ts` — **modified** — expanded
  `LegendaryGameState` with `CardExtId`, `SetupContext`, `PlayerZones`,
  `GlobalPiles`, `MatchSelection` types. G now has `selection`, `playerZones`,
  and `piles` fields.
- `packages/game-engine/src/setup/shuffle.ts` — **new** — `shuffleDeck(cards, context)`
  uses `context.random.Shuffle` exclusively for deterministic shuffling
- `packages/game-engine/src/test/mockCtx.ts` — **new** — `makeMockCtx(overrides?)`
  returns a `SetupContext` with `Shuffle` that reverses arrays (proves shuffle ran)
- `packages/game-engine/src/setup/buildInitialGameState.ts` — **new** —
  builds initial G from validated config: per-player zones (12-card starting
  decks of 8 agents + 4 troopers), global piles sized from config counts,
  selection metadata
- `packages/game-engine/src/game.ts` — **modified** — `setup()` now calls
  `validateMatchSetup` (when registry configured) then `buildInitialGameState`.
  Exports `setRegistryForSetup()` for server-side registry configuration.
- `packages/game-engine/src/index.ts` — **modified** — exports new types,
  `buildInitialGameState`, `shuffleDeck`, well-known ext_id constants,
  `setRegistryForSetup`
- `packages/game-engine/src/game.test.ts` — **modified** — updated to use
  `makeMockCtx` for proper boardgame.io 0.50.x context shape
- Shape test and determinism test — **new** — 17 new tests

**Revision pass (same session):**
- `shuffle.ts` — narrowed parameter type from `SetupContext` to new
  `ShuffleProvider` interface (`{ random: { Shuffle } }`) for future reuse
  in move contexts. Zero behavior change.
- `game.ts` — added `clearRegistryForSetup()` test-only reset hook to
  prevent module-level registry pollution across tests
- `types.ts` — expanded `SetupContext` JSDoc explaining boardgame.io 0.50.x
  `ctx` nesting rationale
- `index.ts` — exports `clearRegistryForSetup` and `ShuffleProvider`
- Shape tests — added 3 invariant tests: starting deck composition
  (8 agents + 4 troopers), selection/matchConfiguration field consistency,
  selection array reference isolation
- Determinism tests — added shuffleDeck immutability test
- Test count: 34 → 38 (4 new invariant tests)

**What a subsequent session can rely on:**
- `@legendary-arena/game-engine` exports a fully functional `buildInitialGameState`
- `shuffleDeck` provides deterministic shuffling via `context.random.Shuffle`;
  accepts any `ShuffleProvider` (not just `SetupContext`)
- `makeMockCtx` is the shared test helper for all future game engine tests
- `Game.setup()` validates config (when registry set) then builds full initial G
- Determinism guaranteed: same inputs + same RNG → identical G
- All 38 tests passing (17 from WP-005A + 21 new)

**Known gaps (expected at this stage):**
- No hero deck (HQ) construction from registry data — future WP
- No villain deck construction — WP-014/015
- No gameplay moves beyond stubs — WP-008A/B
- `setRegistryForSetup` must be called by the server before creating matches
  (server not yet updated — that is a future integration task)
- Starting deck ext_ids are well-known constants, not resolved from registry

### WP-006A — Player State & Zones Contracts (2026-04-10)

**What changed:**
- `packages/game-engine/src/state/zones.types.ts` — **new** — canonical zone
  and player state contracts: `CardExtId`, `Zone`, `PlayerZones`, `PlayerState`,
  `GlobalPiles`, `ZoneValidationError`, `GameStateShape`
- `packages/game-engine/src/state/zones.validate.ts` — **new** — pure runtime
  shape validators: `validateGameStateShape(input)` and
  `validatePlayerStateShape(input)`. Return structured results, never throw.
  No boardgame.io imports.
- `packages/game-engine/src/state/zones.shape.test.ts` — **new** — 4 structural
  tests (2 passing, 2 `{ ok: false }` cases) using `node:test` and `node:assert`
- `packages/game-engine/src/types.ts` — **modified** — `CardExtId`, `PlayerZones`,
  `GlobalPiles` now re-exported from `state/zones.types.ts`. New types `Zone`,
  `PlayerState`, `ZoneValidationError`, `GameStateShape` also re-exported.
  `LegendaryGameState` uses canonical types from `zones.types.ts`.
- `packages/game-engine/src/index.ts` — **modified** — exports new types and
  validators from `state/zones.types.ts` and `state/zones.validate.ts`

**What a subsequent session can rely on:**
- `@legendary-arena/game-engine` exports canonical zone contracts (`CardExtId`,
  `Zone`, `PlayerZones`, `PlayerState`, `GlobalPiles`)
- `ZoneValidationError` is `{ field, message }` — distinct from `MoveError`
- `validateGameStateShape` and `validatePlayerStateShape` are pure helpers
  that check structural shape only — no registry lookups, no throws
- `GameStateShape` is the minimal interface for zone validation
- All 48 tests passing (38 from WP-005B + 10 zone shape tests)

**Known gaps (expected at this stage):**
- No gameplay moves beyond stubs — WP-008A/B
- No hero deck (HQ) or villain deck construction — future WPs
- `PlayerState` is defined but not yet used in `LegendaryGameState` (G uses
  `Record<string, PlayerZones>` directly — `PlayerState` is available for
  move validation in future WPs)

### WP-006B — Player State Initialization (2026-04-10)

**What changed:**
- `packages/game-engine/src/setup/playerInit.ts` — **new** —
  `buildPlayerState(playerId, startingDeck, context)` returns a typed
  `PlayerState` with shuffled deck and 4 empty zones. Uses `ShuffleProvider`
  for the context parameter.
- `packages/game-engine/src/setup/pilesInit.ts` — **new** —
  `buildGlobalPiles(config, context)` returns a typed `GlobalPiles` from
  `MatchSetupConfig` count fields. Contains `createPileCards` helper and
  well-known pile ext_id constants.
- `packages/game-engine/src/setup/buildInitialGameState.ts` — **modified** —
  delegates player creation to `buildPlayerState` and pile creation to
  `buildGlobalPiles`. Retains `buildStartingDeckCards`, `buildMatchSelection`,
  and well-known starting card ext_id constants.
- `packages/game-engine/src/setup/playerInit.shape.test.ts` — **new** — 3 shape
  tests: all zones present, deck reversed (proves shuffle), broken player rejected
- `packages/game-engine/src/setup/validators.integration.test.ts` — **new** — 3
  integration tests: `validateGameStateShape` ok, `validatePlayerStateShape` ok
  for all players, `JSON.stringify(G)` does not throw

**What is now fully initialized and validator-confirmed:**
- `buildInitialGameState` produces a `G` that passes `validateGameStateShape`
- Every player in `G` passes `validatePlayerStateShape`
- Player state construction is isolated in `buildPlayerState` — independently
  testable with its own shape tests
- Global pile construction is isolated in `buildGlobalPiles` — typed against
  canonical `GlobalPiles` from WP-006A
- All 56 tests passing (48 from WP-006A + 8 new)

**Known gaps (expected at this stage):**
- No hero deck (HQ) construction from registry data — future WP
- No villain deck construction — WP-014/015
- No gameplay moves beyond stubs — WP-008A/B

### WP-007A — Turn Structure & Phases Contracts (2026-04-10)

**What changed:**
- `packages/game-engine/src/turn/turnPhases.types.ts` — **new** — defines
  `MatchPhase` (4 values), `TurnStage` (3 values), canonical arrays
  `MATCH_PHASES` and `TURN_STAGES`, and `TurnPhaseError` error shape
- `packages/game-engine/src/turn/turnPhases.logic.ts` — **new** — pure
  transition helpers: `getNextTurnStage`, `isValidTurnStageTransition`,
  `isValidMatchPhase`, `isValidTurnStage`. No boardgame.io imports.
- `packages/game-engine/src/turn/turnPhases.validate.ts` — **new** —
  `validateTurnStageTransition(from, to)` validates both inputs and transition
  legality. Returns structured results, never throws.
- `packages/game-engine/src/turn/turnPhases.contracts.test.ts` — **new** —
  7 contract tests: 2 valid transitions, 2 invalid transitions,
  `getNextTurnStage('cleanup')` returns null, 2 drift-detection tests
- `packages/game-engine/src/types.ts` — **modified** — re-exports
  `MatchPhase`, `TurnStage`, `TurnPhaseError` from turn types
- `packages/game-engine/src/index.ts` — **modified** — exports all new types,
  canonical arrays, transition helpers, type guards, and validator

**What a subsequent session can rely on:**
- `MatchPhase` and `TurnStage` are the canonical union types for phases and stages
- `MATCH_PHASES` and `TURN_STAGES` are the single source of truth arrays
- `getNextTurnStage` defines stage ordering — WP-007B must use it
- `isValidTurnStageTransition` checks forward-adjacent transitions only
- Type guards (`isValidMatchPhase`, `isValidTurnStage`) use array membership
- `validateTurnStageTransition` validates unknown inputs before checking legality
- `TurnPhaseError` uses `{ code, message, path }` — distinct from `ZoneValidationError`
- All 63 tests passing (56 from WP-006B + 7 new)

**Known gaps (expected at this stage):**
- No `G.currentStage` field — that is WP-007B
- No turn advancement logic — that is WP-007B
- No moves, stage gating, or boardgame.io wiring — WP-008A/B

### WP-007B — Turn Loop Implementation (2026-04-10)

**What changed:**
- `packages/game-engine/src/turn/turnLoop.ts` — **new** — `advanceTurnStage(G, ctx)`
  advances `G.currentStage` through the canonical turn stage cycle. Uses
  `getNextTurnStage` from WP-007A for ordering — no hardcoded stage strings.
  Calls `ctx.events.endTurn()` when `getNextTurnStage` returns `null` (after
  cleanup). Defines `TurnLoopContext` and `TurnLoopState` interfaces locally
  to avoid importing boardgame.io.
- `packages/game-engine/src/types.ts` — **modified** — added
  `currentStage: TurnStage` to `LegendaryGameState` with `// why:` comment
  explaining storage in G rather than ctx
- `packages/game-engine/src/game.ts` — **modified** — wired `play` phase with
  `turn.onBegin` (resets `G.currentStage` to `TURN_STAGES[0]` each turn) and
  added `advanceStage` move that delegates to `advanceTurnStage`
- `packages/game-engine/src/index.ts` — **modified** — exports
  `advanceTurnStage`, `TurnLoopContext`, `TurnLoopState`
- `packages/game-engine/src/setup/buildInitialGameState.ts` — **modified** —
  returns `currentStage: TURN_STAGES[0]` in initial G (required by updated
  `LegendaryGameState` type)
- `packages/game-engine/src/game.test.ts` — **modified** — updated move
  assertion to include `advanceStage` (3 moves instead of 2)
- `packages/game-engine/src/turn/turnLoop.integration.test.ts` — **new** —
  4 integration tests: start->main, main->cleanup, cleanup->endTurn called,
  JSON-serializability after each transition

**What a running match can now do:**
- The `play` phase has a functional turn stage cycle: `start -> main -> cleanup`
- Each new turn resets `G.currentStage` to the first canonical stage
- `advanceStage` move advances the stage forward or ends the turn
- `ctx.events.endTurn()` handles player rotation — manual rotation forbidden
- `G.currentStage` is observable to all moves for future stage gating (WP-008A)

**What a subsequent session can rely on:**
- `LegendaryGameState` has `currentStage: TurnStage` — always present in G
- `advanceTurnStage` is exported and uses `getNextTurnStage` exclusively
- `advanceStage` is registered as a move on `LegendaryGame`
- The play phase `turn.onBegin` hook resets stage on each turn
- All 67 tests passing (63 from WP-007A + 4 new)

**Known gaps (expected at this stage):**
- No stage gating on moves — WP-008A defines which moves run in which stages
- No gameplay moves (draw, recruit, fight) — WP-008A/B
- No win/loss conditions — WP-010
- No villain deck or city logic — WP-014/015

### WP-008A — Core Moves Contracts (2026-04-10)

**What changed:**
- `packages/game-engine/src/moves/coreMoves.types.ts` — **new** — defines
  `CoreMoveName` (3 values), `CORE_MOVE_NAMES` canonical array,
  `DrawCardsArgs`, `PlayCardArgs` (uses `CardExtId`), `EndTurnArgs`,
  and the engine-wide `MoveError`/`MoveResult` result contract
- `packages/game-engine/src/moves/coreMoves.gating.ts` — **new** —
  `MOVE_ALLOWED_STAGES` map and `isMoveAllowedInStage` helper. No
  boardgame.io imports.
- `packages/game-engine/src/moves/coreMoves.validate.ts` — **new** — four
  pure validators: `validateDrawCardsArgs`, `validatePlayCardArgs`,
  `validateEndTurnArgs`, `validateMoveAllowedInStage`. All return `MoveResult`,
  never throw. No mutation, no normalization, no coercion.
- `packages/game-engine/src/moves/coreMoves.contracts.test.ts` — **new** —
  13 tests: 3 drawCards, 2 playCard, 3 stage gating, 2 drift-detection,
  2 validateMoveAllowedInStage error cases, 1 endTurn
- `packages/game-engine/src/types.ts` — **modified** — re-exports
  `MoveResult`, `MoveError`, `CoreMoveName`
- `packages/game-engine/src/index.ts` — **modified** — exports all new types,
  constants, gating helpers, and validators

**What a subsequent session can rely on:**
- `@legendary-arena/game-engine` exports the canonical move contracts
- `MoveResult`/`MoveError` are the engine-wide result contract — no future
  packet may redefine or shadow these types
- `CORE_MOVE_NAMES` is the canonical array for drift-detection
- `MOVE_ALLOWED_STAGES` is the sole source of truth for stage gating
- `isMoveAllowedInStage` derives answers from the map only
- All four validators are pure (no throw, no mutation, no boardgame.io)
- `PlayCardArgs.cardId` is typed as `CardExtId` (not plain string)
- All 80 tests passing (67 from WP-007B + 13 new)

**Known gaps (expected at this stage):**
- No move implementations that mutate G — WP-008B
- No card rules, costs, or keyword logic — future WPs
- No villain deck, city, or HQ logic — WP-014/015

### WP-008B — Core Moves Implementation (2026-04-10)

**What changed:**
- `packages/game-engine/src/moves/zoneOps.ts` — **new** — pure zone mutation
  helpers: `moveCardFromZone(from, to, cardId)` returns `{ from, to, found }`;
  `moveAllCards(from, to)` returns `{ from, to }`. Both return new arrays,
  never mutate inputs. No boardgame.io imports. No `Math.random()`.
- `packages/game-engine/src/moves/coreMoves.impl.ts` — **new** — three move
  implementations (`drawCards`, `playCard`, `endTurn`) following three-step
  ordering: validate args, check stage gate, mutate G. Imports validators and
  gating from WP-008A. Uses `shuffleDeck` for reshuffle in `drawCards`.
- `packages/game-engine/src/game.ts` — **modified** — replaced `playCard` and
  `endTurn` stubs with imports from `coreMoves.impl.ts`; added `drawCards` as
  a new move. `advanceStage` remains untouched.
- `packages/game-engine/src/index.ts` — **modified** — exports
  `moveCardFromZone`, `moveAllCards`, `MoveCardResult`, `MoveAllResult`
- `packages/game-engine/src/game.test.ts` — **modified** — updated move-count
  assertion from 3 to 4 (runtime wiring allowance for adding `drawCards`)
- `packages/game-engine/src/moves/coreMoves.integration.test.ts` — **new** —
  9 integration tests covering all three moves, stage gating, reshuffle, and
  JSON serializability

**What a running match can now do:**
- `drawCards`: draws N cards from deck to hand; reshuffles discard into deck
  when deck is exhausted mid-draw (deterministic via `ctx.random`)
- `playCard`: moves a card from hand to inPlay
- `endTurn`: moves all inPlay and hand cards to discard, then calls
  `ctx.events.endTurn()` to advance to the next player
- All three moves enforce stage gating via `MOVE_ALLOWED_STAGES`
- A match can now execute a full turn cycle: draw cards (start/main stage),
  play cards (main stage), end turn (cleanup stage), rotate to next player

**What a subsequent session can rely on:**
- `@legendary-arena/game-engine` exports functional move implementations
- `zoneOps.ts` exports `moveCardFromZone` and `moveAllCards` for reuse in
  future moves (villain deck, recruit, fight)
- WP-008A contracts were NOT modified — all validators, gating, and types
  remain locked
- All 89 tests passing (80 from WP-008A + 9 new)

**Known gaps (expected at this stage):**
- No card effects (attack, recruit, keywords, costs) — future WPs
- No HQ, city, KO zone, or villain deck logic — WP-014/015
- No buying or fighting mechanics — future WPs
- No win/loss conditions — WP-010

### WP-003 — Card Registry Verification & Defect Correction (2026-04-09)

**What was fixed:**
- **Defect 1:** `httpRegistry.ts` was fetching `card-types.json` (card type
  taxonomy) instead of `sets.json` (set index). The Zod parse silently
  produced zero sets because `card-types.json` entries lack `abbr` and
  `releaseDate` fields. Fixed to fetch `sets.json` with a `// why:` comment
  explaining the distinction.
- **Defect 2:** `FlatCard.cost` in `types/index.ts` was typed as
  `number | undefined` but real card data includes star-cost strings like
  `"2*"` (amwp Wasp). Widened to `string | number | undefined` to match
  `HeroCardSchema.cost`.
- Stale JSDoc references to `card-types.json` corrected to `sets.json` in
  `CardRegistry.listSets()` and `HttpRegistryOptions.eagerLoad`.

**What was added:**
- `src/registry.smoke.test.ts` — smoke test using `node:test` confirming
  the local registry loads sets and cards without blocking parse errors
- `test` script in `package.json` for `pnpm --filter @legendary-arena/registry test`
- `tsconfig.build.json` excludes `*.test.ts` from build output

**What is confirmed working:**
- Local registry loads 40 sets (38 parse fully, 2 have known schema issues)
- `listSets().length > 0` and `listCards().length > 0` pass
- Immutable files (`schema.ts`, `shared.ts`, `localRegistry.ts`) were not modified

**Known remaining build errors (pre-existing, out of scope):**
- `localRegistry.ts` — missing `@types/node` type declarations for
  `node:fs/promises` and `node:path`; implicit `any` parameter
- `shared.ts` — `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` strictness (optional fields
  assigned to required fields in `FlatCard`)
- These require modifications to immutable files or adding `@types/node` —
  flagged for a follow-up work packet

### WP-002 — boardgame.io Game Skeleton (2026-04-09)

**What exists now:**
- `packages/game-engine/` — new pnpm workspace package (`@legendary-arena/game-engine`)
  - `src/types.ts` — `MatchConfiguration` (9 locked fields from 00.2 §8.1)
    and `LegendaryGameState` (initial G shape)
  - `src/game.ts` — `LegendaryGame` created with boardgame.io `Game()`,
    4 phases (`lobby`, `setup`, `play`, `end`), 2 move stubs (`playCard`,
    `endTurn`), and a `setup()` function that accepts `MatchConfiguration`
  - `src/index.ts` — named exports: `LegendaryGame`, `MatchConfiguration`,
    `LegendaryGameState`
  - `src/game.test.ts` — JSON-serializability test, field verification,
    phase/move assertions (5 tests, all passing)

**What a subsequent session can rely on:**
- `@legendary-arena/game-engine` is importable as a workspace package
- `LegendaryGame` is a valid boardgame.io 0.50.x `Game()` object
- `LegendaryGame.setup()` accepts `MatchConfiguration` and returns
  `LegendaryGameState` (JSON-serializable)
- Phase names are locked: `lobby`, `setup`, `play`, `end`
- Move stubs exist: `playCard`, `endTurn` (void, no side effects)
- `MatchConfiguration` has exactly 9 fields matching 00.2 §8.1

**Known gaps (expected at this stage):**
- Move stubs have no logic — gameplay implementation starts in WP-005B+
- `LegendaryGameState` contains only `matchConfiguration` — zones, piles,
  counters, and other G fields will be added by subsequent Work Packets
- No card registry integration — engine does not import registry (by design)
- No server wiring — `apps/server/` still uses its own placeholder Game()
