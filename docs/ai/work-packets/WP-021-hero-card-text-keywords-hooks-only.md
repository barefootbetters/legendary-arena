# WP-021 — Hero Card Text & Keywords (Hooks Only)

**Status:** Ready  
**Primary Layer:** Game Engine / Rules (Hero Abilities — Contracts Only)  
**Dependencies:** WP-020

---

## Session Context

WP-009A/009B established the `HookDefinition` + `ImplementationMap` rule
execution pipeline for scheme and mastermind hooks. WP-018 through WP-020
completed the MVP economy, mastermind fight, and VP scoring. This packet
introduces the equivalent representation layer for hero card abilities — a
data-only hook contract and keyword taxonomy that maps hero cards to structured
declarations. **No hero ability logic is executed in this packet.** Execution
is deferred to WP-022+. This packet must remain inert by design.

---

## Goal

Introduce a canonical, deterministic representation of hero card abilities
using hooks and keywords, without executing their effects. After this session:

- `HeroAbilityHook` is a data-only interface (no functions, no closures) that
  maps a hero card to its timing, keywords, conditions, and effect descriptors
- `HeroKeyword` is a closed canonical union of semantic labels
- `G.heroAbilityHooks: HeroAbilityHook[]` is built at setup time from registry
  data and stored in `G` (immutable during gameplay)
- The rule engine can observe, query, and filter hero hooks by timing/keyword
- No hero ability produces gameplay effects — execution is WP-022+
- Future packets can add execution without refactoring the hook contract

---

## Assumes

- WP-020 complete. Specifically:
  - `packages/game-engine/src/rules/ruleHooks.types.ts` exports
    `RuleTriggerName`, `HookDefinition` (WP-009A)
  - `packages/game-engine/src/rules/ruleRuntime.execute.ts` exports
    `executeRuleHooks` (WP-009B)
  - `packages/game-engine/src/economy/economy.types.ts` exports `TurnEconomy`,
    `CardStatEntry` (WP-018)
  - `G.cardStats` exists (WP-018) — hero card stat values resolved at setup
  - `packages/game-engine/src/state/zones.types.ts` exports `CardExtId` (WP-006A)
  - `packages/game-engine/src/test/mockCtx.ts` exports `makeMockCtx` (WP-005B)
  - `pnpm --filter @legendary-arena/game-engine build` exits 0
  - `pnpm --filter @legendary-arena/game-engine test` exits 0
- Card data includes hero cards with `abilities: string[]` arrays containing
  ability text markup (`[keyword:X]`, `[icon:X]`, `[hc:X]`)
- `docs/ai/ARCHITECTURE.md` exists (created in WP-013)
- `docs/ai/DECISIONS.md` exists (created in WP-002)

If any of the above is false, this packet is **BLOCKED** and must not proceed.

---

## Context (Read First)

Before writing a single line:

- `docs/ai/ARCHITECTURE.md §Section 4` — read "The Rule Execution Pipeline".
  `HeroAbilityHook` follows the same data-only pattern as `HookDefinition`:
  data lives in `G`, handler functions live outside `G` (added in WP-022+).
  This packet adds the data layer only.
- `docs/ai/ARCHITECTURE.md §Section 2` — read "Card Data Flow: Registry into
  Game Engine". Hero ability hooks are resolved at setup time from registry
  data, stored in `G`, and never recomputed during moves. Same pattern as
  `G.villainDeckCardTypes` and `G.cardStats`.
- `docs/ai/ARCHITECTURE.md — "Layer Boundary (Authoritative)"` — hero ability
  hooks are game-engine layer only. Registry provides data at setup time.
  No server, persistence, or UI concerns.
- `packages/game-engine/src/rules/ruleHooks.types.ts` — read `HookDefinition`.
  `HeroAbilityHook` follows the same philosophy: data-only, JSON-serializable,
  no functions.
- `docs/ai/REFERENCE/00.6-code-style.md` — key rules: Rule 4 (no abbreviations
  — `heroKeyword` not `hk`), Rule 6 (`// why:` on the hooks-only design and
  on the closed keyword union), Rule 8 (no `.reduce()`), Rule 13 (ESM only).

**Critical design note — this packet is inert by design:**
`HeroAbilityHook` describes what a hero card *can* do. It does not *do* it.
No game state changes result from hero hooks in this packet. The hooks are
observation-only data that WP-022+ will attach execution logic to via an
`ImplementationMap`-style pattern.

---

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

**Engine-wide (always apply — do not remove):**
- Never use `Math.random()` — hook setup involves no randomness
- Never throw inside move functions — this packet adds no moves
- `G` must be JSON-serializable at all times — no class instances, Maps, Sets,
  or functions
- ESM only, Node v22+ — all new files use `import`/`export`, never `require()`
- `node:` prefix on all Node.js built-in imports (`node:test`, `node:assert`,
  etc.)
- Test files use `.test.ts` extension — never `.test.mjs`
- No database or network access in any new file
- Full file contents for every new or modified file in the output — no diffs,
  no snippets
- Human-style code per `docs/ai/REFERENCE/00.6-code-style.md`

**Packet-specific:**
- Registry boundary (hard rule): the game engine must NOT import
  `@legendary-arena/registry` at module scope. Registry data is provided to
  setup as a parameter and used only during setup-time helpers such as
  `buildHeroAbilityHooks`. Moves must never query the registry.
- `HeroAbilityHook` is **data-only** — no functions, no closures, no handler
  references. Fully JSON-serializable.
- `HeroKeyword` is a **closed canonical union** — adding a new keyword requires
  a `DECISIONS.md` entry and updating both the union type and the canonical
  array (drift-detection test required)
- `G.heroAbilityHooks` is built at setup time and **immutable during gameplay**
  — moves must never modify it
- `cardId` in `HeroAbilityHook` must be a hero card `CardExtId`
- Timing values (`'onPlay'`, `'onFight'`, etc.) are **declarative labels only**
  — no execution semantics are attached in this packet
- Effects are **descriptors, not functions** — `HeroEffectDescriptor` describes
  what an effect would do; it does not do it
- Conditions are **declarative** — `HeroCondition` describes when an effect
  applies; no evaluation logic is implemented
- No `.reduce()` in hook construction — use `for...of`
- Tests use `makeMockCtx` or plain mocks — no `boardgame.io` imports

**Session protocol:**
- If any contract, field name, or reference is unclear, stop and ask the human
  before proceeding — never guess or invent field names, type shapes, or file
  paths

**Locked contract values:**

- **HeroAbilityHook shape:**
  ```ts
  interface HeroAbilityHook {
    cardId: CardExtId
    timing: 'onPlay' | 'onFight' | 'onRecruit' | 'onKO' | 'onReveal'
    keywords: HeroKeyword[]
    conditions?: HeroCondition[]
    effects?: HeroEffectDescriptor[]
  }
  ```

- **HeroKeyword closed union:**
  ```ts
  type HeroKeyword =
    | 'draw'
    | 'attack'
    | 'recruit'
    | 'ko'
    | 'rescue'
    | 'wound'
    | 'reveal'
    | 'conditional'
  ```

---

## Scope (In)

### A) `src/rules/heroAbility.types.ts` — new

- `interface HeroAbilityHook` — data-only hook contract as specified in locked
  contract values above
- `interface HeroCondition` — declarative condition descriptor (MVP: type label
  only, e.g., `{ type: 'heroClassMatch'; value: string }`)
- `interface HeroEffectDescriptor` — declarative effect descriptor (MVP:
  `{ type: HeroKeyword; magnitude?: number }`)
- `// why:` comments:
  - `cardId` must be a hero card `CardExtId`
  - Timing is declarative only — no execution
  - Effects are descriptors, not functions
  - Hooks are immutable after setup

### B) `src/rules/heroKeywords.ts` — new

- `type HeroKeyword` — closed union as specified in locked contract values
- `const HERO_KEYWORDS: readonly HeroKeyword[]` — canonical array for
  drift-detection
- Drift-detection test required: array must match union type exactly
- `// why:` comment: keywords are semantic labels only; they do not imply
  magnitude or effect. Adding a new keyword requires a `DECISIONS.md` entry
  and updating both the type and the array.

### C) `src/setup/heroAbility.setup.ts` — new

- `buildHeroAbilityHooks(registry: CardRegistry, matchConfig: MatchSetupConfig): HeroAbilityHook[]`
  — called during `Game.setup()`:
  1. Resolve hero cards from selected hero decks in registry
  2. Extract hero text metadata (ability text is already normalized in registry)
  3. Build a list of `HeroAbilityHook` entries from ability text
  4. Return the list (stored as `G.heroAbilityHooks`)
  - Setup-time only — never recomputed in moves
  - No parsing of natural language — uses structured ability metadata from
    registry
  - No side effects
  - Uses `for...of` (no `.reduce()`)
  - `// why:` comment on setup-time-only pattern

### D) Rule Engine Integration (Observation Only)

- Expose hero hooks to the rule engine so that:
  - Hooks can be observed (iterated, inspected)
  - Hooks can be queried (filtered by `timing` or `keyword`)
  - Hooks can be filtered for a specific card
- But:
  - No hero hook produces effects
  - No rule execution is triggered
  - Execution is deferred to WP-022+
- Implementation: utility functions in `heroAbility.types.ts` or a small
  helper file that filter `G.heroAbilityHooks` — pure, read-only

### E) `src/types.ts` — modified

- Add `heroAbilityHooks: HeroAbilityHook[]` to `LegendaryGameState`
- Re-export `HeroAbilityHook`, `HeroKeyword`, `HeroCondition`,
  `HeroEffectDescriptor`

### F) `src/index.ts` — modified

- Export `HeroAbilityHook`, `HeroKeyword`, `HERO_KEYWORDS`, `HeroCondition`,
  `HeroEffectDescriptor`, `buildHeroAbilityHooks`

### G) Tests — `src/rules/heroAbility.setup.test.ts` — new

- Uses `node:test` and `node:assert` only; uses `makeMockCtx`; no boardgame.io
  import
- Six tests:
  1. `buildHeroAbilityHooks` produces a non-empty array for valid hero decks
  2. Every hook has a valid `cardId` (CardExtId string)
  3. Every hook has a valid `timing` value from the union
  4. Every hook's `keywords` are from the `HeroKeyword` union
  5. `JSON.stringify(hooks)` succeeds (fully serializable)
  6. Drift: `HERO_KEYWORDS` array matches union type exactly
     — `// why:` comment on drift detection

---

## Out of Scope

- **No execution of hero abilities** — WP-022 adds that
- **No conditional logic resolution** — conditions are declarative labels only
- **No keyword semantics** — keywords are labels, not behavior
- **No timing windows beyond labels** — `'onPlay'` means "this triggers on
  play" but no trigger fires in this packet
- **No UI changes**
- **No persistence / database access**
- **No balance tuning**
- **No server changes**
- Refactors, cleanups, or "while I'm here" improvements are **out of scope**
  unless explicitly listed in Scope (In) above
